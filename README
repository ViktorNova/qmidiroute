--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note from ViktorNova: This fork of QMidiRoute makes it more session-manager 
friendly - you can have multiple instances running simultaneously in a session
manager and have it not auto-connect the wrong ports. MIDI in/out ports are now
namespaced according to the filename of the .qma file that is opened, rather than
the previous behaviour of appending the random ALSA client numbers to the port names.
There are also some graphical updates.

QMidiRoute is a MIDI event router and filter. MIDI note, control change,
program change and pitch bend events are logged, and can be filtered, 
redirected and transformed into other events according to MIDI maps 
defined as tabs in the main control surface. 
To start, click the 'Add MIDI map' button. You can copy midi MAPS into new
tabs using the 'Clone MIDI map' button. All MIDI maps can be saved in
a .qma text file.
QMidiRoute can be started using the following options:

   --portCount <num>         Number of Output Ports [2]
   --file <filename>         Open Map File <filename>


Installation
-------------
qmidiroute uses autoconf/automake as build system. For short

  ./configure
  make
  make install

does the trick. Please refer to the INSTALL file for more information.


Building from GIT
-------------
If you start with a fresh GIT clone, please first apply

  autoreconf -i

to get a proper configure script. For more instructions about compiling
and installing this application please refer to the INSTALL file.
